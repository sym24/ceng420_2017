To run it, type either "python importCSV.py" for regular or "python one_vs_all.py" for one vs all learning.

If you want to keep the best chromosome, and overwrite the old best, end it with CTRL+C (in one_vs_all, CTRL+C moves on to the next population), otherwise end it with CTRL+Z

If you want to add the previous best chromosome to your new population at the beginning, type "y" after it prompts you for it

The best chromosome gets saved to a python script called classifier.py that you can use to classify a poker hand
